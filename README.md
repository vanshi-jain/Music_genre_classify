## Music Genres Classification using XGBoost

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?select=Data)
   - Obtain a dataset containing audio features (e.g., spectral features, tempo, pitch, timbre) and corresponding genre labels.
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing feature values, and encoding categorical variables like genre labels.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extract relevant features from the audio data using signal processing techniques or pre-trained audio feature extraction models.
   - Select important features or perform dimensionality reduction techniques if necessary to reduce computational complexity.

4. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate model performance properly.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Train an XGBoost classifier using the training data and tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation to assess model generalization and prevent overfitting.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model on the validation set using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC).
   - Fine-tune model parameters based on validation performance.

7. **Model Testing:**
   - Assess the final model's performance on the test set to measure its ability to generalize to unseen data accurately.
